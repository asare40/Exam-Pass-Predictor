# Project Overview
The JAMB Score Prediction System is a machine learning application designed to help students predict their likelihood of success in the Joint Admissions and Matriculation Board (JAMB) examination based on various personal, academic, and lifestyle factors.

## How It Works
Our system uses a Random Forest Classifier trained on historical JAMB examination data. By analyzing patterns in this data, the model can identify which factors contribute most significantly to a student's success and make predictions for new students.

## Key Features
Personalized JAMB score prediction based on student information
Analysis of the impact of individual factors on examination success
Data-driven recommendations to improve chances of passing
Comprehensive visualization of feature relationships with JAMB results

##Benefits
This predictive tool helps:
Students identify areas for improvement before taking the examination
Educators understand which factors most influence student success
Educational institutions develop targeted support strategies
Researchers analyze trends in JAMB examination performance

## About JAMB
The Joint Admissions and Matriculation Board (JAMB) is a Nigerian entrance examination board for tertiary-level institutions. The board conducts entrance examinations for prospective undergraduates into Nigerian universities.

## Data and Privacy
All prediction data is processed locally and is not stored or shared. The system uses anonymized historical data for training the prediction model.
### Data Privacy
This application does not store any user-provided information. All predictions are made in real-time and no personal data is saved.
