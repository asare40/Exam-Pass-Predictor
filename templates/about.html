        <h2>Project Overview</h2>
        <p>The JAMB Score Prediction System is a machine learning application designed to help students predict their likelihood of success in the Joint Admissions and Matriculation Board (JAMB) examination based on various personal, academic, and lifestyle factors.</p>
        
        <h2>How It Works</h2>
        <p>Our system uses a Random Forest Classifier trained on historical JAMB examination data. By analyzing patterns in this data, the model can identify which factors contribute most significantly to a student's success and make predictions for new students.</p>
        
        <h3>Key Features</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>Personalized JAMB score prediction based on student information</li>
            <li>Analysis of the impact of individual factors on examination success</li>
            <li>Data-driven recommendations to improve chances of passing</li>
            <li>Comprehensive visualization of feature relationships with JAMB results</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>Benefits</h2>
        <p>This predictive tool helps:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Students identify areas for improvement before taking the examination</li>
            <li>Educators understand which factors most influence student success</li>
            <li>Educational institutions develop targeted support strategies</li>
            <li>Researchers analyze trends in JAMB examination performance</li>
        </ul>
        
        <h2>About JAMB</h2>
        <p>The Joint Admissions and Matriculation Board (JAMB) is a Nigerian entrance examination board for tertiary-level institutions. The board conducts entrance examinations for prospective undergraduates into Nigerian universities.</p>
        
        <h2>Data and Privacy</h2>
        <p>All prediction data is processed locally and is not stored or shared. The system uses anonymized historical data for training the prediction model.</p>
